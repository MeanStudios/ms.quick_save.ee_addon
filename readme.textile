Greetings,

jQuery Quick Save is an ExpressionEngine extension which gives you the ability to use Ctrl+s while editing a template to quickly save it.  You can also use Ctrl+Shift+s to quickly save and return to the template list.

Version 2.0.2 has the added feature of Auto-Save.  It is set at a default of 120 seconds.  While editing your templates, it will auto-save your template every 2 mins.  The delay can be changed in the extension settings.

*Setup*

__For people upgrading from a version earlier than 2.0.2, I recommend disabling the extension first and then uploading the new files.__

# Download the extension and place the files in the correct folders using the same file structure as the downloaded file
# Enable jQuery for the Control Panel  (v.1.1.1)
# Enable jQuery Quick Save
# Set the full url to the JS files included in this download. *Don't forget to include a trailing slash "/"!!*
# Enjoy :)

*Known Issues*

# Minor conflict with "CM Template Editor":http://www.caleydon.com/expressionengine/template-editor/ - The auto-save feature does not work and you can only use shortcut keys if you do not have the cursor inside templated edit form.  There are no errors though.

Let me know if you have any questions.
